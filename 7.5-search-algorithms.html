    <h3>Linear Search Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
      1. Get array and target Values
      2. set a counter to i = 0
      3. Check if the element at arr[i] is equal to the target value
      4. If element matches, return index (i). Otherwise, increment i by 1 and repeat step 3
      5. If the index is greater than the last index of an array, return-1 to indicate the target value was not found. 
    </p>

    <h3>Binary Search Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
      1. Sort array

      2. Set the low index to 0 and high index to length - 1
    
       3. Set middle index to average of low and high
    
       4. If the middle index is the target, return the middle index
    
       5. If the target element is less than the element at the middle index, set the high index to the middle index â€“ 1
    
       6. If the target element is greater than the element at the middle index, set the low index to the middle index + 1
    
       7. Repeat steps 3-6 until low and high index are equal
    
       8. Return -1 if element is not found
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithm Efficiency</h3>
    <p>
      Algorithm efficiency is often represented by how many maximun steos it would take for the algorithm to run. Computer scientists use the "Big O" notation.
